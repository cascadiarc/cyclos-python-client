Returns the a specific record type the authenticated user can view over the given user or system if the `system` owner is used.  

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: accessClient
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Access-Client-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Access-Client-Token'] = 'Bearer'
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: basic
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# Configure API key authorization: session
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Session-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Session-Token'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.RecordsApi(swagger_client.ApiClient(configuration))
owner = 'owner_example' # str | Can be one of: * a user identification value, such as id, username, e-mail, phone, etc.   Id is always allowed, others depend on Cyclos configuration. Note that   a valid numeric value is always considered as id. For example, when   using another identification method that can be numeric only, prefix   the value with a single quote (like in Excel spreadsheets), for   example, `'1234567890`;     * `self` for the currently authenticated user; * `system` for data that belongs to the system. 
type = 'type_example' # str | Either the identifier or internal name of the record type
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).   (optional)

try:
    # Returns a single record type over a user or system
    api_response = api_instance.get_record_type_by_owner(owner, type, fields=fields)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling RecordsApi->get_record_type_by_owner: %s\n" % e)
```

Searches for records of a specific type over any owner

Returns records matching the search criteria, for a specific type. The custom fields returned on each record depend on the field configuration, which needs to be enabled to return on list. The profile fields available as search filters for records are assigned in the products (or admin group permissions). 

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: accessClient
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Access-Client-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Access-Client-Token'] = 'Bearer'
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: basic
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# Configure API key authorization: session
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Session-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Session-Token'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.RecordsApi(swagger_client.ApiClient(configuration))
type = 'type_example' # str | Either the identifier or internal name of the record type
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).   (optional)
brokers = ['brokers_example'] # list[str] | Either the ids or identification methods of record owners' brokers  (optional)
creation_period = ['2013-10-20T19:20:30+01:00'] # list[datetime] | The minimum / maximum record creation date  (optional)
custom_fields = ['custom_fields_example'] # list[str] | Record custom field values used as filters. Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon).  For example, `customFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, customFields=field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `customFields=tradeType:offer|search,extraDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `tradeType` is either `offer` or `search`, and whose `extraDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customFields=extraDate:|2001-12-31`. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `customFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `customFields=dynamic:'business`.  (optional)
groups = ['groups_example'] # list[str] | Either the ids or internal names of record owners' groups  (optional)
keywords = 'keywords_example' # str | Textual search keywords. Sometimes, like in user search, the fields matched depends on what is configured on the products.  (optional)
page = 56 # int | The page number (zero-based) of the search. The default value is zero.  (optional)
page_size = 56 # int | The maximum number of records that will be returned on the search. The default value is 40. The maximum number of returned results is configured in Cyclos, and even if more than that is requested, it will be limited by that setting.  (optional)
profile_fields = ['profile_fields_example'] # list[str] | User profile fields, both basic (full name, login name, phone, e-mail, etc) and custom fields, that are used for search. Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon). For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * `name` or `fullName`: Full name; * `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; * `email`: E-mail; * `phone`: Phone; * `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; * `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it   is required that users either have images or not).  If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request.  The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the   street address, which are `addressLine1`,    `addressLine2`,   `street`,   `buildingNumber` and   `complement`. Note that normally only a   subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line   1 / 2 or street + number + complement);  * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.  A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.  (optional)

Returns records matching the search criteria, for a specific type,  either for system or user records, depending on the `owner` parameter. The custom fields returned on each record depend on the field configuration, which needs to be enabled to return on list. The profile fields available as search filters for records are assigned in the products (or admin group permissions). 

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: accessClient
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Access-Client-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Access-Client-Token'] = 'Bearer'
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: basic
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# Configure API key authorization: session
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Session-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Session-Token'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.RecordsApi(swagger_client.ApiClient(configuration))
owner = 'owner_example' # str | Can be one of: * a user identification value, such as id, username, e-mail, phone, etc.   Id is always allowed, others depend on Cyclos configuration. Note that   a valid numeric value is always considered as id. For example, when   using another identification method that can be numeric only, prefix   the value with a single quote (like in Excel spreadsheets), for   example, `'1234567890`;     * `self` for the currently authenticated user; * `system` for data that belongs to the system. 
type = 'type_example' # str | Either the identifier or internal name of the record type
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).   (optional)
creation_period = ['2013-10-20T19:20:30+01:00'] # list[datetime] | The minimum / maximum record creation date  (optional)
custom_fields = ['custom_fields_example'] # list[str] | Record custom field values used as filters. Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon).  For example, `customFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, customFields=field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `customFields=tradeType:offer|search,extraDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `tradeType` is either `offer` or `search`, and whose `extraDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customFields=extraDate:|2001-12-31`. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `customFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `customFields=dynamic:'business`.  (optional)
keywords = 'keywords_example' # str | Textual search keywords. Sometimes, like in user search, the fields matched depends on what is configured on the products.  (optional)
page = 56 # int | The page number (zero-based) of the search. The default value is zero.  (optional)
page_size = 56 # int | The maximum number of records that will be returned on the search. The default value is 40. The maximum number of returned results is configured in Cyclos, and even if more than that is requested, it will be limited by that setting.  (optional)
profile_fields = ['profile_fields_example'] # list[str] | User profile fields, both basic (full name, login name, phone, e-mail, etc) and custom fields, that are used for search. Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon). For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * `name` or `fullName`: Full name; * `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; * `email`: E-mail; * `phone`: Phone; * `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; * `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it   is required that users either have images or not).  If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request.  The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the   street address, which are `addressLine1`,    `addressLine2`,   `street`,   `buildingNumber` and   `complement`. Note that normally only a   subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line   1 / 2 or street + number + complement);  * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.  A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.  (optional)

Searches for records with shared fields

Returns records matching the search criteria, using shared fields. This allows searching over multiple record types that use shared fields. The custom fields returned on each record depend on the field configuration, which needs to be enabled to return on list. The profile fields available as search filters for records are assigned in the products (or admin group permissions).

Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, &#x60;profileFields&#x3D;rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31&#x60; would match results whose custom field with internal name &#39;rank&#39; is either bronze or silver, and whose &#39;birthDate&#39; is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like &#x60;profileFields&#x3D;birthDate:|2001-12-31&#x60;. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * &#x60;name&#x60; or &#x60;fullName&#x60;: Full name; * &#x60;username&#x60;, &#x60;loginName&#x60; or &#x60;login&#x60;: Login name; * &#x60;email&#x60;: E-mail; * &#x60;phone&#x60;: Phone; * &#x60;accountNumber&#x60;, &#x60;account&#x60;: Account number; * &#x60;image&#x60;: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it   is required that users either have images or not).  If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the &#x60;addressFieldsInSearch&#x60; field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request.  The specific address fields are: * &#x60;address&#x60;: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * &#x60;address.address&#x60;: Searches on the fields that represent the   street address, which are &#x60;addressLine1&#x60;,    &#x60;addressLine2&#x60;,   &#x60;street&#x60;,   &#x60;buildingNumber&#x60; and   &#x60;complement&#x60;. Note that normally only a   subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line   1 / 2 or street + number + complement);  * &#x60;address.zip&#x60;: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * &#x60;address.poBox&#x60;: Searches for matching postal box; * &#x60;address.neighborhood&#x60;: Searches by neighborhood; * &#x60;address.city&#x60;: Searches by city; * &#x60;address.region&#x60;: Searches by region (or state); * &#x60;address.country&#x60;: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.  A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: &#x60;profileFields&#x3D;dynamic:a|b|c&#x60;. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: &#x60;profileFields&#x3D;dynamic:&#39;business&#x60;.  | [optional]

import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: accessClient
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()

try:
    # Updates an existing record
    api_instance.update_record(id, record)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling RecordsApi->update_record: %s\n" % e)
```

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **id** | **str**| The object identification | 
 **record** | [**RecordEdit**](RecordEdit.md)| The record to be edited | 

### Return type

void (empty response body)

# **view_record**
> RecordView view_record(id, fields=fields)

Returns details of a specific record

Returns information about a record, located by id

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: accessClient
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Access-Client-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Access-Client-Token'] = 'Bearer'
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: basic
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# Configure API key authorization: session
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Session-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Session-Token'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.RecordsApi(swagger_client.ApiClient(configuration))
id = 'id_example' # str | The object identification
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).   (optional)

try:
    # Returns details of a specific record
    api_response = api_instance.view_record(id, fields=fields)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling RecordsApi->view_record: %s\n" % e)
```
