Subscribes for receiving push notifications of specific types

Returns an event stream of server-sent events

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.PushApi()
client_id = 'client_id_example' # str | An id generated by the client. This id is valid for the authenticated used, indicating a single session. As event streams can timeout and be reconnected, subsequent subscriptions with the same user and client id are considered the same subscription, and missed events since the last timeout will be immediately delivered. Missed events are enqueued up to a few minutes after the connection timeout. After that window, any enqueued events are discarded. 
kinds = ['kinds_example'] # list[str] | The event kinds for which the client desires to subscribe Possible values for each array element are: * accountStatus: The account status (balance, reserved amount, etc) has changed * loggedOut: The current session has been invalidated * newMessage: New message on the user's inbox * newNotification: New received notification * ticket: A ticket status has changed 
account_ids = ['account_ids_example'] # list[str] | When subscribing to `accountStatus` events, this parameter must be informed to select the accounts to be watched for.  (optional)
ticket_number = 'ticket_number_example' # str | When subscribing to `ticket` events, this parameter can be used to filter which ticket to monitor.  (optional)
last_event_id = 'last_event_id_example' # str | The last received event id, in case of reconnections. May also be passed as the standard header `Last-Event-ID`.  (optional)

try:
    # Subscribes for receiving push notifications of specific types
    api_instance.subscribe_for_push_notifications(client_id, kinds, account_ids=account_ids, ticket_number=ticket_number, last_event_id=last_event_id)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling PushApi->subscribe_for_push_notifications: %s\n" % e)
```
