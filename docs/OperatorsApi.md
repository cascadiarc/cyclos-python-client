[**get_general_operators_data_for_search**](OperatorsApi.md#get_general_operators_data_for_search) | **GET** /operators/data-for-search | Get configuration data for searching operators of any managed user

# **get_general_operators_data_for_search**
> GeneralOperatorsDataForSearch get_general_operators_data_for_search(fields=fields)

Get configuration data for searching operators of any managed user

Returns data with the current configuration regarding the search of operators of managed users. This is meant to be used by either administrators or brokers  

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.OperatorsApi()
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).   (optional)

try:
    # Get configuration data for searching operators of any managed user
    api_response = api_instance.get_general_operators_data_for_search(fields=fields)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling OperatorsApi->get_general_operators_data_for_search: %s\n" % e)
```

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **fields** | [**list[str]**](str.md)| Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned.

This works for nesting as well. For example: &#x60;a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2&#x60; will return the fields &#x60;a&#x60;, &#x60;b&#x60; (containing only the &#x60;b1&#x60; field) and &#x60;c&#x60; (containing all its fields except for &#x60;c1&#x60; or &#x60;c2&#x60;).   | [optional]

Note that   a valid numeric value is always considered as id. For example, when   using another identification method that can be numeric only, prefix   the value with a single quote (like in Excel spreadsheets), for   example, `'1234567890`;     * `self` for the currently authenticated user. 
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned.
