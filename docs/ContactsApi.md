This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).

custom_fields = ['custom_fields_example'] # list[str] | Concat custom field values used as filters. Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon).  For example, `customFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, customFields=field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `customFields=tradeType:offer|search,extraDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `tradeType` is either `offer` or `search`, and whose `extraDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customValues=extraDate:|2001-12-31`.        (optional)
keywords = 'keywords_example' # str | Textual search keywords. Sometimes, like in user search, the fields matched depends on what is configured on the products.  (optional)
order_by = 'order_by_example' # str | Possible options for ordering the results of a contact list. Possible values are: * alphabeticallyAsc: Users are ordered by name (or whatever field is set to format users) in ascending order. * alphabeticallyDesc: Users are ordered by name (or whatever field is set to format users) in descending order. * relevance: This is the default if keywords are used. Best matching users come first.  (optional)
page = 56 # int | The page number (zero-based) of the search. The default value is zero.  (optional)
page_size = 56 # int | The maximum number of records that will be returned on the search. The default value is 40. The maximum number of returned results is configured in Cyclos, and even if more than that is requested, it will be limited by that setting.  (optional)

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **user** | **str**| Can be one of: * a user identification value, such as id, username, e-mail, phone, etc.   Id is always allowed, others depend on Cyclos configuration. Note that   a valid numeric value is always considered as id. For example, when   using another identification method that can be numeric only, prefix   the value with a single quote (like in Excel spreadsheets), for   example, &#x60;&#39;1234567890&#x60;;     * &#x60;self&#x60; for the currently authenticated user.  | 
 **fields** | [**list[str]**](str.md)| Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: &#x60;a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2&#x60; will return the fields &#x60;a&#x60;, &#x60;b&#x60; (containing only the &#x60;b1&#x60; field) and &#x60;c&#x60; (containing all its fields except for &#x60;c1&#x60; or &#x60;c2&#x60;).   | [optional] 
 **custom_fields** | [**list[str]**](str.md)| Concat custom field values used as filters. Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon).  For example, &#x60;customFields&#x3D;field1:value1,field2:value2&#x60;. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, customFields&#x3D;field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, &#x60;customFields&#x3D;tradeType:offer|search,extraDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31&#x60; would match results whose custom field with internal name &#x60;tradeType&#x60; is either &#x60;offer&#x60; or &#x60;search&#x60;, and whose &#x60;extraDate&#x60; is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like &#x60;customValues&#x3D;extraDate:|2001-12-31&#x60;.        | [optional] 
 **keywords** | **str**| Textual search keywords. Sometimes, like in user search, the fields matched depends on what is configured on the products.  | [optional] 
 **order_by** | **str**| Possible options for ordering the results of a contact list. Possible values are: * alphabeticallyAsc: Users are ordered by name (or whatever field is set to format users) in ascending order. * alphabeticallyDesc: Users are ordered by name (or whatever field is set to format users) in descending order. * relevance: This is the default if keywords are used. Best matching users come first.  | [optional] 
 **page** | **int**| The page number (zero-based) of the search. The default value is zero.  | [optional] 
 **page_size** | **int**| The maximum number of records that will be returned on the search. The default value is 40. The maximum number of returned results is configured in Cyclos, and even if more than that is requested, it will be limited by that setting.  | [optional]

# **search_contacts**
> list[UserResult] search_contacts(user, fields=fields, ignore_profile_fields_in_list=ignore_profile_fields_in_list, include_group=include_group, include_group_set=include_group_set, keywords=keywords, page=page, page_size=page_size, profile_fields=profile_fields)

Search users which are contacts of a specific user

Returns a page of users that are contacts of the given user. This path works as such for backwards compatibility reason. In general, seaching the contact list of a user should use the `GET /{user}/contact-list` operation instead. That way contact custom fields will be properly handled. However the `GET /{user}/contacts` operation is kept for simple cases where only the contact users, not the contact relation are desired. The fields returned depend on the products, in the profile fields of other users setting. Only fields (both basic or custom) marked to be returned on user list are returned. If no fields are set to be returned, the resulting objects will have the `display` and `shortDisplay` filled in. However, those fields are not returned when another profile field is returned, preventing duplicated data to be returned.

user = 'user_example' # str | Can be one of: * a user identification value, such as id, username, e-mail, phone, etc.   Id is always allowed, others depend on Cyclos configuration. Note that   a valid numeric value is always considered as id. For example, when   using another identification method that can be numeric only, prefix   the value with a single quote (like in Excel spreadsheets), for   example, `'1234567890`;     * `self` for the currently authenticated user. 
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).   (optional)
ignore_profile_fields_in_list = true # bool | When set to `true`, instead of returning users with corresponding profile fields set on list, will return them with `display` and `shortDisplay`.   (optional)
include_group = true # bool | When set to `true` and the logged user has permission to view user groups, will return the `group` property on users.   (optional)
include_group_set = true # bool | When set to `true` and the logged user has permission to view user group sets, will return the `groupSet` property on users.   (optional)

profile_fields = ['profile_fields_example'] # list[str] | User profile fields, both basic (full name, login name, phone, e-mail, etc) and custom fields, that are used for search. Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon). For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`. The basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers: * `name` or `fullName`: Full name; * `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; * `email`: E-mail; * `phone`: Phone; * `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; * `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it   is required that users either have images or not).  If address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request.  The specific address fields are: * `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); * `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the   street address, which are `addressLine1`,    `addressLine2`,   `street`,   `buildingNumber` and   `complement`. Note that normally only a   subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line   1 / 2 or street + number + complement);  * `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; * `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; * `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; * `address.city`: Searches by city; * `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); * `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.  A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.  (optional)

try:
    # Search users which are contacts of a specific user
