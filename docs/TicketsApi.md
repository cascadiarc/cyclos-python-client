# **accept_ticket**
> Transaction accept_ticket(ticket, fields=fields, confirmation_password=confirmation_password)

This operation is deprecated, use `POST /tickets/{ticket}/approve` instead.

After a successful acceptance a new direct payment from the logged user (i.e the payer) to the user who generated the ticket will be generated ONLY if the ticket doesn't have a `successUrl` nor `successWebhook`. Otherwise the ticket goes to the `approved` status and no  payment is generated. 

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: accessClient
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Access-Client-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Access-Client-Token'] = 'Bearer'
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: basic
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# Configure API key authorization: session

configuration.api_key['Session-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Session-Token'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.TicketsApi(swagger_client.ApiClient(configuration))
ticket = 'ticket_example' # str | The ticket number
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).   (optional)
confirmation_password = 'confirmation_password_example' # str | The password used to confirm this action, if needed. The actual password type, if any, depends on the Cyclos configuration for the current channel.  (optional)

try:
    # This operation is deprecated, use `POST /tickets/{ticket}/approve` instead.

    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling TicketsApi->accept_ticket: %s\n" % e)

# **get_data_for_easy_invoice**
> DataForEasyInvoice get_data_for_easy_invoice(user, fields=fields, amount=amount, type=type, currency=currency, custom_fields=custom_fields)

Returns data for an easy invoice to the given user 

An easy invoice is a pre-filled payment to an user. Other users can use this for a payment template to that user, with pre-filled data. If an amount is specified, then either there must be only payment types of a single currency to the given user, or either a payment type or currency must be informed. 

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.TicketsApi()
user = 'user_example' # str | Can be one of: * a user identification value, such as id, username, e-mail, phone, etc.   Id is always allowed, others depend on Cyclos configuration. Note that   a valid numeric value is always considered as id. For example, when   using another identification method that can be numeric only, prefix   the value with a single quote (like in Excel spreadsheets), for   example, `'1234567890`;     * `self` for the currently authenticated user. 
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).   (optional)
amount = swagger_client.BigDecimal() # BigDecimal | The easy invoice amount. If provided and the user has multiple currencies, either `type` or `currency` is required.  (optional)
type = 'type_example' # str | The payment type id or qualified internal name (in the form `fromAccountType.paymentType`). Either this or `currency` should be informed if an `amount` was given and the user has multiple currencies.  (optional)
currency = 'currency_example' # str | The currency id or internal name. Either this or `type` should be informed if an `amount` was given and the user has multiple currencies.  (optional)
custom_fields = ['custom_fields_example'] # list[str] | Custom field values. Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by : (colon). For example, `customFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `customFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `rank` is either bronze or silver, and whose `birthDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.        (optional)

try:
    # Returns data for an easy invoice to the given user 
    api_response = api_instance.get_data_for_easy_invoice(user, fields=fields, amount=amount, type=type, currency=currency, custom_fields=custom_fields)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:

# **get_ticket_qr_code**
> file get_ticket_qr_code(ticket, size=size)

Returns the QR-code image for the given ticket only if its status is `open` 

This request will return the image contents as expected but our api  documentation page (or any other usage of an &lt;img&gt; tag), created  using swagger-ui, generates a second request to include the image in the page. This new (GET) request won't send the authentication parameters and  as this path requires authentication the image will be shown as broken. Optionally, to solve the problem described above and to allow authenticate the user when using sessions, a `sessionToken` or `accessClientToken`  query parameter could be specified. 

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.TicketsApi()
ticket = 'ticket_example' # str | The ticket number.
size = 'size_example' # str | The possible sizes of images. The actual pixel size depends on the configuration in Cyclos Possible values are: * large: Full image size * medium: Medium thumbnail * small: Small thumbnail  (optional)

try:
    # Returns the QR-code image for the given ticket only if its status is `open` 
    api_response = api_instance.get_ticket_qr_code(ticket, size=size)
    pprint(api_response)

# **new_ticket**
> Transaction new_ticket(ticket, fields=fields)

Creates a new ticket with status `open` for the logged user. 

The logged user will be the ticket's owner and then the receiver of the  payment generated after processing the ticket only if was previously approved by the payer. 

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import swagger_client
from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: accessClient
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Access-Client-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Access-Client-Token'] = 'Bearer'
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: basic
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# Configure API key authorization: session
configuration = swagger_client.Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Session-Token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['Session-Token'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = swagger_client.TicketsApi(swagger_client.ApiClient(configuration))
ticket = swagger_client.TicketNew() # TicketNew | The data to create the new ticket
fields = ['fields_example'] # list[str] | Select which fields to include on returned data. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Unprefixed field names will be handled like a whitelist (only listed fields will be included), while names starting with a minus (-) or exclamation mark (!) will be handled as blacklist (listed fields will not be included). This works for nesting as well. For example: `a,b.b1,c.-c1,c.-c2` will return the fields `a`, `b` (containing only the `b1` field) and `c` (containing all its fields except for `c1` or `c2`).   (optional)

try:
    # Creates a new ticket with status `open` for the logged user. 
    api_response = api_instance.new_ticket(ticket, fields=fields)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling TicketsApi->new_ticket: %s\n" % e)
```
